## 5.2 Actions

1. To empower yourself in the digital world, one must be willing to use technology in useful, innovative ways and also responsibly. Using their skills to solve problems and benefit others is a great example of what makes someone empowered. Being empowered in the digital world also requires someone to have access to technology and internet services, and due to the digital divide, not everyone does.

2. An empowered person can help a non-empowered person by helping them solve problems that they would not normally be able to address. At DNHS, something I could do is build a website that benefits a group of people that may not be able to create one themselves or help make planners to keep people effcient and prevent them from procrastinating.

3. I believe red tape does contribute to blocking digital empowerment. At Del Norte, for example, certain websites are blocked by the school wifi and these links are determined by the school district. This blocks potentially useful sites, which could prevent certain classes from being digitally empowered.
