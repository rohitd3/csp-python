- 1. PII in my current CSP project is abundant. We are making a student database, so the information of Del Norte students is in our project like their name, grade, and class period. 
- 2. We have a lot of PII and it might be dangerous if this information got leaked. As a result, we will work to make sure that the information is not exposed to anyone that should not have access to it.
- 3. A good password is one that is hard to guess and one that is long enough such that it cannot easily be brute forced. A bad password is something like qwerty123 that is easy to guess, or something like just 123 that can be brute forced by an algorithm. Another step to assist in authentication is two step verification, where another device needs to verify a login.
- 4. Symmetric encryption utilizes only one key to encrypt, and this key must be kept private. The encription and decryption algorithms both rely on this key, so anyone with the key is able to encrypt and decrypt a message. Asymmetric encryption utilizes two keys to encrypt, one being the public key and one being the private key. Usually the public key is used to encrypt while the public key is used to decrypt, but there are exceptions where the opposite happens. For this, the public key can be known by anyone because the decryption algorithm relies on the private key so knowing the public key will not help to decipher the message.
- 5. We used SSL in deployment for encryption.
- 6. One phishing scheme I learned about the hard way is when I tried to get free gems in Clash of Clans and I put in some information and got a virus. Other phishing techniques are like through emails that give you malware by clicking on an attachment or a popup claiming a 1000 dollar reward.

## Learning Objective

* Describe the risks to privacy from collecting and storing personal data on a computer system. 

## Essential Knowledge

* Personally identifiable information (PII) is information about an individual that identifies, links, relates, or describes them.
* EX: Social Secuirity #, age, race
* Search engine can record and maintain a history of searches made by users.
* Websites can record and maintain a history of individuals who have viewed their pages. 
* Devices, websites, and networks can collect information about a user’s location.
* Technology enables the collection, use, and exploitation of information about, by, and for individuals, groups, and institutions.
* Search engines can use search history to suggest websites or for targeted marketing.
* Disparate personal data, such as geolocation, cookies, and browsing history, can be aggregated to create knowledge about an individual.  
* PII and other information placed online can be used to enhance a user’s online experiences.
* PII stored online can be used to simplify making online purchase.
* Commercial and government curation of information may be exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored. 
* Information placed online can be used in ways that were not intended and that may have a harmful impact. For example, an email message may be forwarded, tweets can be retweeted, and social media posts can be viewed by potential employers. 
* PII can be used to stalk or steal the identity of a person or to aid in the planning of other criminal acts. 
* Once information is placed online, it is difficult to delete.
* Programs can collect your location and record where you have been, how you got there, and how long you were at a given location.
* Information posted to social media services can be used by others. Combining information posted on social media and other sources can be used to deduce private information about you.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain how computing resources can be protected and can be misused. 

## Essential Knowledge

* Authentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access. Examples of authentication measures include strong passwords and multifactor authentication
* A strong password is something that is easy for a user to remember, but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. 
* Multifactor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a user is only granted access after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism, typically in at least two of the following categories: knowledge, possession, and ingerence. 
* Multifactor authentication requires at least two steps to unlock protected information; each step adds a new layer of security that must be broken to gain unauthorized access.
* Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Decryption is the process of decoding the data. Two common encryption approaches are:
* Symmetric key encryption involves one key for both encryption and decryption. 
* Public key encryption pairs a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message, but the receiver’s private key is required to decrypt the message.
* Certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validates the ownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model. 
* Computer virus and malware scanning software can help protect a computing system against infection.
* A computer virus is a malicious program that can copy itself and gain access to a computer in an unauthorized way. Computer viruses often attach themselves to legitimate programs and start running independently on a computer. 
* Malware is software intended to damage a computing system or to take partial control over its operation.
* All real world systems have errors or design flaws that can be exploited to compromise them. Regular software updates help fix errors that could compromise a computing system. 
* Users can control the permissions programs they have for collecting user information. Users should review the permission settings of programs to protect their privacy.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain how unauthorized access to computing resources is gained. 

## Essential Knowledge

* Phishing is a technique that attempts to trick a user into providing personal information. That personal information can then be used to access sensitive online resources, such as bank accounts and emails.
* Keylogging is the use of a program to record every keystroke made by a computer user is order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information. 
* Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point. 
* A roque access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks.
* A malicious link can be disguised on a web page or in an email message. 
* Unsolicited emails, attachments, links, and forms in emails can be used to compromise the security of a computing system. These can come from unknown senders or from known senders whose security has been compromised. 
* Untrustworthy downloads from freeware or shareware sites can contain malware.
