Rohit's intial Create Task Plan

* Displays animal pictures - interactive
* Clicking on the pictures initiates a sound of that animal
* Input: User clicks on image
* Output: Recording of that animal's unique noise
* Sequence will be shown using HTML and Javascript
* Iteration will be used when going through the different animal images and noises which are stored in a list

Part A

| Section | Question | Answer | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| i| Describe the overall purpose of the program | The overall purpose of the program is to click on the image presented on screen and it would play some sound related to the image. The create task follows the theme of the silverscreen website and includes shows and movie images along with its corresponding sound effect or dialogue.  |
| ii| Describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video| The functionality if the program that is demonstrated in the video is the playing of the sound effects and the highlighting of image. |
| iii| Describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video| The input of the program is the user selects and image to play and the output is the corresponding sound will play. |

Part B

| Section | Question | Answer | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| i | The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list. | <img width="432" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44128572/155902777-79619ab8-a2fc-4fb9-892c-5c437c54cfab.png"> <br>|
| ii| The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.| <img width="341" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44128572/155902886-c8fdf7ac-3ab3-4a96-b3d9-784bb2a39abd.png">|
| iii | Identifies the name of the list being used in this response| <img width="226" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44128572/155902939-89d07430-73ed-4c54-985f-b32d57b6a43e.png">|
| iv | Describes what the data contained in the list represent in your program| The data in the list is the mp3 files that are played when the images are clicked on by the user. |
| v | Explains how the selected list manages complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list| The list manages the complexity of the program because it stores the mp3 files used for the output when the images, also stored in a list, are clicked. If we did not use a list for this, it would be difficult to store the files efficiently that are needed for the output. Without the list, we would have to hard code each response for when each image is clicked and that would make the code even larger. |

Part C

| Section | Question | Answer | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| i| The first program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that: Defines the procedure’s name and return type (if necessary), contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the functionality of the procedure, and implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection and iteration| <img width="407" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44128572/155903224-827f8308-aad1-49af-b828-bd558f4ac3f0.png">|
| ii| The second program code segment must show where your student-developed procedure is being called in your program| <img width="340" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44128572/155903240-58209380-36db-4413-a31e-3248c08ed87b.png"> |
|iii |Describes in general what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program | This function will take the user input of whichever image they choose, and will listen for this event. It will then play the corresponding sound effect, interrupting any other intiated events. |
|iv | Explains in detailed steps how the algorithm implemented in the identified procedure works. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it.| First the images are created from a list and then on click event, the picture is identified, and the corresponding sound is played for a certain time or until another image is clicked.|

Part D:

| Section | Question | Answer | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| i| Describes two calls to the procedure identified in written response3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.|<img width="279" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44128572/155903129-bfa3f20f-97d1-440e-a839-b0dbe5ca25b3.png"> <br> <img width="132" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44128572/155903143-5b51bad9-6259-4672-9b36-49d61ab8642f.png">|
| ii| Describes what condition(s) is being tested by each call to the procedure| Conditions that is being tested by each call is that it waits for the next click on an image and can interrupt to the play the next sound. |
| iii| Identifies the result of each call| <img width="320" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44128572/155904035-13620659-ff87-4991-a4b6-8daf2ddec89f.png"> |
