# 5.5 Github Pages actions

## 1.

- MIT license is completely opensource and someone can use all the code as they wish and make any changes and show the code as their own.
- Creative Commons gives up any right to copyright and allows anyone to use the code you've written.
- Open Source GPL License is similar to MIT License except they cannot put out a derivative version of the code as their own. 

## 2.

- Our team project uses the MIT license. Our project is geared towards being open source, and there is no need for us to have patents. We want our sponsor, Mr. M, to be able to use the software for free; it is unlikely to be used elsewhere. We also want him to be able to use the software and easily make any derivative changes as he sees fit.
- My individual project also uses the MIT license. I have not written any unique code that I wish to keep for myself; I think everyone should be able to use my code and make any changes they want without any problems.
